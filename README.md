Selenium + Chrome Headless in Docker
===

Run Chrome Headless with Selenium Server Standalone in Docker.

Build the images
---

First, build the Selenium Server image

    docker build -t selenium-server  selenium-server

Then, build the Chrome image 

    docker build -t selenium-chrome chrome

By default, the image is built using Chrome Beta, as stable Chrome is not so stable when running test suites that
navigate in windows. You can build an image for stable Chrome with:

    docker build -t selenium-chrome-stable --build-arg CHROME_VERSION=stable .

Run
---

    docker run -it -p 4444:4444 selenium-chrome

You might need to map some host names:

    docker run -it --add-host "example.org example.com":192.168.99.102 -p 4444:4444 selenium-chrome

Running tests
---

Your test harness needs must be pointed to the container's address, and Selenium has to be instructed, when starting
a session, to use Chrome in headless mode.

For example, if you are using Behat:

```yaml
default:
  extensions:
    Behat\MinkExtension:
      base_url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
      default_session: selenium_chrome
      sessions:
        selenium_chrome:
          selenium2:
            wd_host: http://192.168.99.104:4444/wd/hub
            browser: chrome
            capabilities:
              extra_capabilities:
                chromeOptions:
                  args:
                    - "--headless"
                    - "--no-sandbox"
```
